Coding challenge
This is intended to be a small coding exercise meant to gauge your programming style. 
Package up your response in a .out file

The problem
You’re tasked with taking entries of personal information in multiple formats and normalizing each entry into a standard JSON format. Write your formatted, valid JSON out to a file with two-space indentation and keys sorted alphabetically.

Input
Your program will be fed an input file of n lines. Each line contains “entry” information, which consists of a first name, last name, phone number, color, and zip code.

The order and format of these lines vary in three separate ways. 
The three different formats are as follows:

Lastname, Firstname, (703)-742-0996, Blue, 10013 
Firstname Lastname, Red, 11237, 703 955 0373 
Firstname, Lastname, 10013, 646 111 0101, Green

Some lines may be invalid and should not interfere with the processing of subsequent valid lines. A line should be considered invalid if its phone number does not contain the proper number of digits.

Output
The program should write a valid, formatted JSON object out to std.out. The JSON representation should be indented with two spaces and the keys should be sorted in ascending order.

Successfully processed lines should result in a normalized addition to the list associated with the “entries” key. 
For lines that were unable to be processed, a line number i (where 0 ≤ i < n) for each faulty line should be appended to the list associated with the “errors” key.
The “entries” list should be sorted in ascending alphabetical order by (last name, first name).
