There are one-hundred light switches in a row. They are all initially off. 
The act of ‘switching’ is changing the light from its current state to its opposite state (e.g. on to off, and vice-versa). 
You walk the row of light switches multiple times. 
The first pass you switch each one; 
the second pass, you switch every second;
the third, every third and so on, 
until you’ve reached one-hundred passes. 
Write a function that calculates how many lights are switched on at the end of the hundred passes. 
Python is preferred for this question.
